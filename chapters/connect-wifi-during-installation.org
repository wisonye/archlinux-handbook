* Connect to WIFI during installation

You can use [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/iwd][iwctl]] to do the job.

** Enable your WIFI NIC (Network Interface Card)

Make sure to change the =wlan0= to yours if your NIC doesn't =wlan0=, print the NIC name by running ~ip add~

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  ip link set wlan0 up
#+END_SRC


You can list all WIFI devices like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  iwctl device list
#+END_SRC

Show its status:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  iwctl device wlan0 show

  # Name         wlan0
  # Mode         station
  # Powered      on
  # Address      XX:XX:XX:XX
  # Adapter      phy0 (NIC physical hardware name)
#+END_SRC

If the device or its corresponding adapter is turned off, turn it on before the next step:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  iwctl device wlan0 set-property Powered on
  iwctl adapter phy0 set-property Powered on
#+END_SRC


** Scan your WIFI SSID

If you don't know the =SSID= or not sure your =SSID= is scannable or not, then run it to confirm

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  iwlist station wlan0 scan | grep SSID
#+END_SRC


** Connet to WIFI

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  #
  # Connect to public SSID
  #
  iwctl station wlan0 connect "SSID"

  #
  # Or connect to hidden SSID
  #
  iwctl station wlan0 connect-hidden "SSID"

  #
  # After that, check your IP address
  #
  ip add
#+END_SRC

Maybe you need to run =dhcpcd &= to grab a new IP if your router doesn't do that for you.

After you can access to internet, enable =NTP= to sync your clock

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  timedatectl set-ntp true
#+END_SRC
