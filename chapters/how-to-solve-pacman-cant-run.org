* Solve -pacman- can't run

When you run =doas pacman --sync --refresh XXXX= to upgrade the installed program, it updates =icu= (or another important shared libraries) partially, sometimes it will cause =pacman= can't run anymore like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  pacman error while loading shared libraries libicuuc.so.74: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
#+END_SRC

That's because =pacman= relies on that =libicuuc.so.74= shared library to run but that library has been upgraded to a higher version, that's why =pacman= can't run anymore.

That said, you can't run =doas pacman -Syu= to upgrade the rest of the system, as =pacman= binary doesn't work!!!!

So, you have to download the latest runnable version of Pacman binary (statically linked) to upgrade the rest of your system. You need to go to =pacman-static= AUR (https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pacman-static) to find the Pre compiled binaries and download it.

For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  cd ~/temp
  "https://pkgbuild.com/~morganamilo/pacman-static/x86_64/bin/pacman-static" -O ./pacman-static
  chmod +x ./pacman-static

  #
  # Upgrade the rest of the installed binaries
  #
  doas ./pacman-static -Syu

  #
  # Do a reboot to take affect
  #
  doas reboot
#+END_SRC
